.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a terminal multiplexer,
a program that allows multiple terminal sessions to run within a single
(physical or virtual)
terminal session.
.Pp
The options are
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Tell
.Nm
to use VT100-style sequences for the backspace and delete keys.
This is needed only if you instruct
.Nm
to advertise itself as some other kind of terminal that sends these sequences
.Po
e.g. a VT100
.Pc "."
You probably don't need to use this option.
.It Fl m
Enable mouse support.
When mouse support is enabled,
clicking button 1 will focus the virtual terminal under the click,
and programs run under
.Nm
can request to be advised of mouse events in their virtual terminals.
.Pp
Note that enabling mouse support may alter how the host terminal application responds
to the mouse;
for example,
it may require holding down the
.Dq shift
key to recognize mouse clicks targeting itself.
.It Fl T Ar HOST
Assume that the host terminal
.Po
i.e. the terminal under which
.Nm
is running
.Pc
is of type
.Ar HOST "."
By default,
the contents of the
.Ev HOST
environment variable are used.
.It Fl t Ar TERMINAL
Set the
.Ev TERM
environment variable within the mtm session to
.Ar TERM "."
By default, this is
.Em "eterm-color" "."
.It Fl c Ar CHARACTER
Commands are prefixed using
.Ar CHARACTER
in combination with the
.Dq control
key.
By default this is
.Dq "g" "."
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl u
flag is recognized but ignored,
for backwards compatibility.
.Pp
.Ss Usage
.Nm
divides the screen into multiple virtual terminals.
Each virtual terminal is updated and accessed independently.
At any given time,
exactly one virtual terminal is
.Dq focused ","
meaning that it receives any typed characters.
The currently-focused terminal is indicated by the location of the cursor.
.Pp
While running,
the following keys are recognized as commands to
.Nm
when prefixed with the command character:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em "Up/Down/Right/Left Arrow"
Select the terminal above/below/to the right of/to the left of the currently focused one.
.It Em "h" "or" "v"
Split the focused terminal in half horizontally
.Pq "for 'h'"
or vertically
.Pq "for 'v'" ";"
the newly-created terminal will be focused.
.It Em "w"
Delete the currently focused terminal.
.It Em "l"
.Pq "the letter ell"
Redraw the screen.
.El
.Pp
Note that these command keys,
and the default prefix,
can be changed at compile time and therefore may be different for this installation of
.Nm "."
.Pp
.Nm
will exit when its last virtual terminal is closed.
.Ss The Value of Fl t
The terminal name passed to
.Fl t
does not change how
.Nm
interprets command sequences,
but rather changes what kind of terminal
.Nm
claims to be.
Safe bets for this value are
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It mtm
This is the terminal described by the
.Pa mtm.ti
.Xr terminfo 5
description that shipped with
.Nm "."
It is not necessarily installed on your system,
but if it is, it will tell programs how to use all of the
.Nm
features,
including cursor visibility changes.
.It eterm-color
This is the default.
It is widely supported and its description is installed by default on most systems.
The only user-visible difference when using this terminal name is that programs will
not necessarily know how to change cursor visibility.
.It vt100
.Nm
emulates most of the venerable VT100's behavior,
except for those things that cannot be portably emulated
.Po
double-height characters, for example
.Pc "."
Note that the VT100 did not support color or changing the cursor's visibility,
so advertising that
.Nm
is a VT100 will cause most programs to stop displaying color.
The VT100's behavior is almost universally supported.
.Pp
When advertising a VT100 terminal type, the
.Fl b
option should probably be used.
.El
.Ss Host Terminal Capabilities
.Nm
presents a consistent set of terminal capabilities to programs run under it.
However,
if the host terminal does not support certain features
.Po
e.g. mouse tracking,
color,
or blinking text
.Pc
those features will
.Po
obviously
.Pc
likewise not be available to programs run under
.Nm mtm "."
.Pp
Note that in some
.Xr terminfo 5
databases,
the default
.Em xterm
entries do not describe how to enable mouse position tracking.
If such tracking is needed,
setting the host terminal type
.Po
via the host's
.Ev TERM
environment variable or via the
.Fl T
option
.Pc
to something else
.Po
often
.Em xterm-1002
or similar
.Pc
may help.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the operation of
.Nm mtm ":"
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TERM
Names the hosting terminal's type.
This can be overridden using the
.Fl T
option.
.It Ev ESCDELAY
This variable specifies the number of milliseconds
.Nm
will wait after seeing an escape character for a special character sequence to complete.
By default this is 1000
.Pq "one second" "."
.It Ev LC_CTYPE Ev LC_ALL Ev LANG
These variables are consulted to determine the encoding used for textual data.
.It SHELL
If set,
.Nm
will launch the program named by this command in new virtual terminals.
If this is unset,
.Nm
will use the value of the
.Dq "command interpreter"
field of the password database
.Po
see
.Xr passwd 5
.Pc
if available,
and will finally use
.Pa "/bin/sh" "."

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
The mouse-tracking support is still in its preliminary stages.
.Pp
.Nm
will attempt to fit all virtual terminals in the window at once.
If many terminals are created and the containing window is shrunk too small,
the display will be suboptimal.
.Pp
The only human language in which output is generated and in which documentation
is available is English,
regardless of the user's preferred language.
